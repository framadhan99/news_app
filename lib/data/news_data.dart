The press release noted that the workers are employed on an egg farm in Franklin County."

        "Tesla earnings live updates: Stock jumps 12% after hours as company reports big quarterly profit beat - Business Insider",
    content:
        "Tesla delivered a quarterly profit that beat Wall Street's expectations as it reported its earnings on Wednesday. The electric carmaker reported earnings per share of \$0.62 — a big beat over analysts' expectations of \$0.51. Revenue came in slightly below analysts' expectations at \$25.18 billion for the quarter, an 8% year-over-year increase. Tesla's gross margin, which is closely watched by Wall Street, rose to 19.8%. new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for the start of production in the first half of 2025. The stock was up 12% in after-hours trading at the conclusion of Tesla's analyst call, during which Elon Musk and executives spent most of the time going over prepared remarks or answering previously submitted questions from retail investors. The executives took two questions from analysts dialed into the call. Earlier this month, Musk revealed Tesla's long-awaited driverless Cybercab robotaxi at its We, Robot event. While the event generated considerable hype for Tesla, the driverless taxi plan has been met with skepticism over its feasibility and competition with rivals. The rollout of the vehicle, which Tesla expects to begin production in 2026, hinges on Tesla receiving regulatory approval for its Full Self-Driving software for fully autonomous rides. Musk said he expects Tesla to gain regulatory approval for fully autonomous rides in Texas and California next year and called for a pathway to national approval for fully driverless cars. Musk referenced Trump's proposed government-efficiency commission, saying, if there's a department of government efficiency, I'll try to help make that happen. In the meantime, Tesla said the adoption of its FSD beta software had increased since the Cybercab event. The Tesla CEO also discussed lower-cost vehicles, which Tesla the company has said it's working on. Musk said people shouldn't expect Tesla to make a Cybercab model with a steering wheel and pedals, saying a regular \$25K model is pointless and silly. The company is all-in on autonomous vehicles, Musk said.",

    content:
        "Feeling peachy! One lucky Powerball player in Georgia won an estimated \$478 million prize Wednesday night, breaking the state’s nearly decade-long drought of hitting the lottery’s jackpot.
